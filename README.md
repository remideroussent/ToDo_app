# ToDo App 📝

## About the Project

This ToDo App is a simple and intuitive task management application that helps you organize your daily life. A ToDo app (or "To Do List") is a digital tool that replaces the traditional notebook for managing your daily tasks, projects, and reminders.

### Key Features
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks
- 🗑️ Delete completed tasks
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed
- 📱 Modern and responsive user interface

## My First Application

This is my very first mobile application! This project allowed me to learn the basics of mobile development with React Native and understand the fundamental concepts of application programming.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development framework
- **Expo** - Development platform that simplifies React Native app creation
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Programming languages

### Why React Native?

React Native allows you to develop a single application that works on both **iOS** and **Android**, making it an ideal cross-platform solution for getting started with mobile development.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your mobile device

### Cloning the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Running the Application

### Using Expo Go

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```

2. Download the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device:
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

3. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or browser with:
   - **iOS**: Camera app or Expo Go app
   - **Android**: Expo Go app directly

4. The app will load automatically on your device!

### Alternative Testing Methods

- **iOS Simulator** (Mac only):
```bash
npm run ios
```

- **Android Emulator**:
```bash
npm run android
```
